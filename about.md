title: About Me
---

My name is Jamie Adams (a.k.a, "Imodium Operator") and I am a principal software engineer with 30+ years of experience delivering secured, high-assurance systems, including Cross-Domain Solutions (CDS) and Multilevel Security (MLS) platforms. I have also architected and supported robust auditing and logging frameworks that ensure accountability, data integrity, and rapid detection of anomalies. 

I am a seasoned high-assurance engineering practitioner with deep expertise in secure Linux/UNIX environments, system administration, C/Python/Rust development, SNMPv3 integration, and FIPS-compliant cryptography. Highly disciplined in consistently producing comprehensive, precise, and rigorously structured technical documentation that drives engineering excellence and operational clarity.

For nearly two decades I contributed to accredited CDS and MLS products, including:
* Forensic-quality audit/event subsystems aligned with RTB requirements
* Remote guard monitoring with MLS-enforced separation
* CDS-MIB and SNMPv3 notification integrations
* Protocol adapters enabling safe SMTP and printing across security boundaries
* High-assurance secure coding, formal testing, and FIPS-aligned architecture reviews

## Work Philosophy
I value clarity, correctness, simplicity, and security. Code should be readable, predictable, and maintainable under pressure. System administrators should never have to guess what a tool is doing. Effective secure engineering is a mix of discipline, respect for constraints, and clean design.


## Repositories You’ll Find Here
- Rust command-line tools (classical ciphers, secure coding demonstrations)
- Python GTK3 utilities for secure administration and cryptographic verification
- Secure logging and auditing subsystem demonstrations
- Linux MLS/SELinux educational examples
- Documentation templates and technical essays
- Wizard-themed branding artifacts for fun and teaching

## Disclaimers
All public repositories are provided solely for educational, illustrative, and experimental use. They are not turnkey or accredited MLS/CDS solutions, and any cryptographic examples may lack FIPS validation. Independent security review and accreditation must be performed before using any code operationally.

All content is derived exclusively from publicly available cybersecurity standards, guidelines, and open-source documentation, with links provided where applicable. No sensitive, classified, or system-specific configurations appear in any material; all examples are generic and instructional. Recommendations and best practices reflect over 30 years of professional experience in secure systems and are aligned with public standards while remaining entirely independent of any real-world system configuration.

Welcome.

I am a Software Engineer, security nerd, and longtime builder of high-assurance MLS/CDS systems. This site is a public notebook for engineering work and design reasoning, with a focus on high-assurance Linux systems and tooling. <img src="/assets/images/umrs-logo-1024px.png" align="left" width=200>

My primary project is the [UNCLASSIFIED MLS Reference System Project](https://github.com/jamieadams-nerd/umrs-project/blob/main/README.md).
<p></p>The Unclassified MLS Reference System (UMRS) is an ongoing high assurance engineering project built on top of Red Hat Enterprise Linux 10 operating in FIPS mode. The system is fully STIG-locked, configured for SELinux MLS with a complete unclassified label hierarchy, and structured to demonstrate—not merely describe—how a real organization can tailor, customize, and extend a commercial Linux distribution to satisfy its own security requirements.</p>


Long-form documentation lives in project repositories. This site is for context, rationale, and ongoing work.

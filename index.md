Welcome.

This site is a public notebook for engineering work and design reasoning, with a focus on high-assurance Linux systems, logging, auditing, and tooling.

I am a Software Engineer, security nerd, and longtime builder of high-assurance MLS/CDS systems.

Long-form documentation lives in project repositories. This site is for context, rationale, and ongoing work.
